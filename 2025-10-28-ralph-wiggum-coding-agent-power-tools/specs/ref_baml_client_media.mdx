# Image / Audio / Pdf / Video

> Learn how to handle image, audio, Pdf, and video inputs in BAML functions

BAML functions can accept image, audio, Pdf, and video inputs for multimedia processing capabilities. Choose the appropriate type based on your needs:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Image" icon="image" href="./image">
    Create Image objects from URLs, base64 data, or browser-specific sources like File and Blob objects.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Audio" icon="volume-high" href="./audio">
    Create Audio objects from URLs, base64 data, or browser-specific sources like File and Blob objects.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Pdf" icon="file-pdf" href="./pdf">
    Create Pdf objects from URLs, base64 data, or browser-specific sources like File and Blob objects.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Video" icon="video" href="./video">
    Create Video objects from URLs, base64 data, or browser-specific sources like File and Blob objects.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## URL Resolution

BAML automatically handles URL-to-base64 conversion based on provider requirements. You can control this behavior using the `media_url_handler` configuration option in your client definition.

By default:

* URLs are converted to base64 for providers that don't support external URLs
* Google Cloud Storage URLs (gs\://) are preserved when using Google providers
* MIME types are added when required by the provider

See the client configuration documentation for provider-specific defaults and configuration options.

# Cursor

To install on Cursor, try searching "bam" or "baml" (note the latter search term may cause an error due to a bug with Cursor).

If you can't find it, you can download the right extension .vsix file from [Open-VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Boundary/baml-extension), and drag it to the extensions panel:

### Cursor Rules to write BAML

We created a [.cursorrules file for BAML](https://gist.github.com/aaronvg/b4f590f59b13dcfd79721239128ec208), to aid Cursor in writing BAML prompts. Feel free to edit this however you like!

title: "Ralph Wiggum under the hood: Coding Agent Power Tools"
description: |
  We've talked a lot about how to use context engineering to get more out of coding agents. In this episode,
  we dive deep on the Ralph Wiggum technique and why this different approach can reshape your coding workflow.
  We explore how Ralph handles greenfield work, refactors, and spec generation—surprise: it's all about
  higher-quality context engineering.

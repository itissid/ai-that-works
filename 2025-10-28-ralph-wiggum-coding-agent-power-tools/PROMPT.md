You are implementing a single step of the minibaml, a programming language in zig that implements
the specifications of the BAML language.

0a. read @specs/llms.txt to understand the structure of the specifications

0b. familiarize yourself with the source code in this directory

1. read @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and implement the single highest priority feature using up to 50 subagents

2. ensure all tests and linting passes, then update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with your progress

3. use `git add -A` and `git commit -m "..."` to commit your changes - do not include any claude attribution

Ensure implementation steps are organized around verifiable milestones, and that you have either a) validated them or b) documented the validation steps or what's not working.

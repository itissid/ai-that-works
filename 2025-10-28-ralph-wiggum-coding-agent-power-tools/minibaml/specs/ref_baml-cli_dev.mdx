# dev

The `dev` command starts a development server that watches your BAML source
files for changes and automatically reloads the BAML runtime. This feature is
designed to streamline the development process by providing real-time updates as
you modify your BAML configurations.

## Usage

```
baml-cli dev [OPTIONS]
```

## Details

See the [serve](./serve) command for more information on the arguments.

The dev command performs the exact same functionality, but it additionally:

1. Watches the BAML source files for changes.
2. Automatically reloads the server when changes are detected.
3. Automatically runs any generators when changes are detected.

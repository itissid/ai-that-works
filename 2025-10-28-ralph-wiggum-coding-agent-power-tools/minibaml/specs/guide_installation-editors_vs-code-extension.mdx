## Opening BAML Playground

Once you open a `.baml` file, in VSCode, you should see a small button over every BAML function: `Open Playground`.

Or type `BAML Playground` in the VSCode Command Bar (`CMD + Shift + P` or `CTRL + Shift + P`) to open the playground.

## Setting Env Variables

Click on the `Settings` button in top right of the playground and set the environment variables.

It should have an indicator if any unset variables are there.

The playground should persist the environment variables between closing and opening VSCode.

<Tip>
  You can set environment variables lazily. If anything is unset you'll get an error when you run the function.
</Tip>

<Info>
  Environment Variables are stored in VSCode's local storage! We don't save any additional data to disk, or send them across the network.

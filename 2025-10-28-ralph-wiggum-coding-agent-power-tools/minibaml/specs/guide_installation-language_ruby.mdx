To set up BAML with Ruby do the following:

<Steps>
  ### Install BAML VSCode Extension

  [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=boundary.baml-extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=boundary.baml-extension)

  * syntax highlighting
  * testing playground
  * prompt previews

  ### Install BAML

  ```bash bundle
  bundle add baml sorbet-runtime
  ```

  ### Add BAML to your existing project

  This will give you some starter BAML code in a `baml_src` directory.

  ```bash
  bundle exec baml-cli init
  ```

  ### Generate Ruby code from `.baml` files

  ```bash
  bundle exec baml-cli generate
  ```

  \`
  See [What is baml\_src](/guide/introduction/baml_src) to learn more about how this works.

  As fun as writing BAML is, we want you be able to leverage BAML with existing ruby modules. This command gives you a ruby module that is a type-safe interface to every BAML function.

  <Tip>
    Our [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Boundary.baml-extension) automatically runs this command when you save a BAML file.
  </Tip>

  ### Use a BAML function in Ruby!

  <Error>
    If 

    `baml_client`

     doesn't exist, make sure to run the previous step!

              puts msg.inspect
          end

      end
